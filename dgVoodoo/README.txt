If you experience a MAV error during loading/launching the game (or low FPS), and the video driver name in the error window includes terms like "Primary Driver" or "UHD Graphics [number]"
move these three files to the game folder (the one where the .exe file is located). This should help.
After these adjustments, the game may run properly but with some minor issues (e.g., gamma problems). Please, contact us if you have any questions (links are available in the game launcher).
Thanks for understanding.
